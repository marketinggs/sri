# Food Delivery App

This repository contains the frontend for a sample food delivery mobile app built with React Native (Expo). All data is hard coded in `data/data.json`.

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm install     # install dependencies
npm start       # start Expo
npm run android # run on Android emulator
npm run ios     # run on iOS simulator
```

## Features
- Home screen with category carousel and list of food items
- Product screen with item details and add to cart
- Cart screen for reviewing items
- Checkout screen (dummy)
- Profile screen

The color scheme used throughout the app:
- `#453447`
- `#492B4B`
- `#FFDB01`
- `#1D1D1D`

All icons rely on `react-native-vector-icons` (via Expo). Images and data are placeholders for demonstration purposes.
